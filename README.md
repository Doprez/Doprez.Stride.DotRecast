# Doprez.Stride.DotRecast
An implementation of DotRecast in Stride with included Bepu Physics support and the ability to provide your own geometry data.

> [!CAUTION]
> This library will break a ton as I continue working with it. But Bepu needed a navigation library since the old Stride implementation was heavily tied to Bullet physics and could not be reused elsewhere.
